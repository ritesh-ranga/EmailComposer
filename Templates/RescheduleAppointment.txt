Dear @@RECEIVER_FIRST_NAME@@,

While I was looking forward to our meeting on @@ORIGINAL_DATE@@, I regretfully will have to reschedule.

I am still very interested in meeting. I am available on @@NEW_DATE_1@@ and @@NEW_DATE_2@@. However, if these dates do not work for you, please let me know when you might be able to meet.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, and I look forward to meeting with you on a different date.

Sincerely,
@@SENDER_FIRST_NAME@@
